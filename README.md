# Boston-housing-price-prediction
This is our Assignment No. 1. 
Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression 
In this project we will work on developing an end to end machine learning project using linear regression, as this will be your first project in your machine learning journey. We will be doing extensive data visualization, we will perform data feature engineering, we will also see how we can select features based on the correlation of the features
Boston Housing Price Prediction - 
Linear Regression using Google colab

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in Boston using various socio-economic and structural features. The model is built and evaluated using Python and Scikit-learn in a Google Colab.

# Project Overview -

The goal of this project is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) in Boston suburbs based on different features such as crime rate, age, property tax rate, etc.

# Dataset Information -

The Boston Housing dataset contains 506 samples with 13 features:

Feature	Description -

CRIM	- Per capita crime rate

ZN	 - Residential land zoned (%)

INDUS	- Proportion of non-retail business acres

CHAS	- Charles River dummy variable

NOX	  - Nitric oxides concentration

RM	  - Average number of rooms

AGE	 - Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS	  - Distance to employment centers

RAD	  - Index of accessibility to highways

TAX	  - Property tax rate

PTRATIO	= Pupil-teacher ratio

B	    - Proportion of Black population

LSTAT	 - % lower status of population
